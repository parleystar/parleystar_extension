### [English Documentation](#summary)
<hr />
## <span id="summary">Summary</span>

## What is this extension? 
- This extension exists to provide a better user experience for multi-streaming/simulcasting, or mobile livestream chat viewing. This deals with trying out new chat ideas. 


## What is this document? 
- This document will explain to live-streamers, live-stream moderators, and power users of live streams what ParleyStar is and how to use it for personal usage. If you are a developer or interested in that side, look at readme-developer-version.md .

- We are NOT on Github. We are trying out other code repository products.


## Features
-- Log chat, highlight or filter types or words of chat, view chat offline when you lose connection, multi-stream/simulcast/shared chat, search chat by different options or by keyword or user, view chat on VODs, translate chat from user language to viewer language and make it look how you want.


## So, its for Twitch? Livestreams are Twitch, so this is a Twitch extension? Because I like Twitch, I should use this for Twitch? Get to the point about how I can use ParleyStar for Twitch?
- We have been in closed alpha and beta testing of new platforms, and have many friends and relationships around the world, so we have been or are building for and testing Parleystar on livestreams on the following livestream platforms:
ArenaTV
BigoLive 
CHZZK (Naver)

Locals
Nimo
Noice
Odysee
Parleystar

Rooter
Rumble
Shareplay
Soop (AfreecaTV)
Tiktok
Trovo

Youtube
Don't panic, we are building and testing on Twitch. We do not care which streaming site you prefer.


## Desktop Browsers supported

Google Chrome
Chromium-based (Brave, Vivaldi, Edge, Arc, etc)


## Future Desktop Browsers targeted to support

Firefox (and its forks)
Orion


## Mobile Android Browsers supported

## Online/Offline
- A goal of this project is to provide seamless online/offline chat viewing ability so that if you lose connection, you can still view the stream chat offline.


## Translation
- A goal of this project is to provide all menus, settings and text in the extension in all supported languages by Google Chrome/Android which is around 100 languages at the time of writing this. We are building in a way in which you can easily switch the menus from English to Spanish or vice-versa, for example. Another goal is to save livestream chat to your device so it can be roughly translated for you to read in your native language in almost real-time.

## HOW TO USE
-- enable the browser extension and navigate to a live stream. 

Desktop -- Pop-out chat and refresh page if needed. Icons will be at the top of the screen to open the menu and choose your settings. It runs in the background after that. It only works on pop-out chat on desktop for now.

Mobile -- Open the browser menu (usually 3 dots icon) which has settings like History, Bookmarks, New Tab, etc.  At the bottom of that menu is "ParleyStar". Tap this to open the Parleystar menu. It runs in the background after that.


## Multi-Streaming / Shared Chat
Open more than 1 pop-out chat and in the settings menu, choose the same chat destination in each of them. Now, you can read all different chats you have open in one feed.
